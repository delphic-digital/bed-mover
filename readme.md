 - Install [node](https://nodejs.org)
 - clone this repo into `C:/dev/` or wherever you like (but you'll have to change the paths)
 - run 'npm install -g gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0`
 - run `npm install`

 ---

 That should be all the tech, now open up `gulpfile.js` and check the paths match your local environment.

 ---

 Now the dream: run `gulp`
